# Executive Summary (Auto)

- Base Revenue: $9,250,000; Operating Margin: -596.4%
- Unit economics (Base): Revenue bps of TPV = 92.5 bps; Cost+Loss bps of TPV = 77.5 bps.
- Best-case OM: -477.0% (Δ +119.4 pts vs Base) driven by higher TPV/take rate and lower network/loss costs.
- Downside OM: -716.0% (Δ -119.6 pts vs Base) driven by higher loss rate/network fees and weaker TPV.
- Next: extend sensitivities to (TPV vs network_cost_bps) and add a target-margin backsolve for pricing/volume.
